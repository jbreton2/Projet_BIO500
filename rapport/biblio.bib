	abstract = {Spatial patterns m species richness of the complete New World avifauna were analysed, using data previously employed to examine spatial trends in geographic range size This allowed variation in the patterns to be compared Species richness was highest around the equator, and decreased towards higher latitudes in both hemispheres This decrease was asymmetrical, at equivalent latitudes, richness was higher in the southern than in the northern hemisphere, although the reverse was true for a measure of endemism Controlling for latitude, species richness was higher in the west than m the east The net primary productivity of, and solar radiation received by an area were both correlated with species richness However, neither explained more variation in richness than did latitude No single mechanism developed to explain spatial patterns in species richness satisfactrily explains the patterns observed in the New World avifauna We discuss, reasons why this might be the case Finally, we point out that species richness at low latitudes is not simply a multiplication of richness at high latitudes, species found at high and low latitudes are unlikely to be ecologically equivalent Any mechanism that is proposed to explain richness patterns in New World birds will need also to account for this observation},

	abstract = {Adaptation to climate change requires prediction of its impacts, especially on ecosystems. In this work we simulated the change in bird species richness in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada, under climate change scenarios. To do so, we first analyzed which geographical and bioclimatic variables were the strongest predictors for the spatial distribution of the current resident bird species. Based on canonical redundancy analysis and analysis of variance, we found that annual temperature range, average temperature of the cold season, seasonality of precipitation, precipitation in the wettest season, elevation, and local percentage of wet area had the strongest influence on the species’ distributions. We used these variables with Random Forests, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and Maximum Entropy models to explain spatial variations in species abundance. Future species distributions were calculated by replacing present climatic variables with projections under different climate change pathways. Subsequently, maps of species richness change were produced. The results showed a northward expansion of areas of highest species richness towards the center of the province. Species are also likely to appear near James Bay and Ungava Bay, where rapid climate change is expected.},
